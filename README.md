# Personal-Website
With an aim to learn HTML, CSS, and possibly Javascript, this is my personal website.


Here is the link to my university's provided personal website: www.homepage.usask.ca/~tup916



Currently, I have only put up an HTML, and a CSS file for styling.
All images are created using Inkscape, GIMP, and the good-old Paint. Some images were hand-drawn as well.

Future plans:
Near future: 
Incorporte Javascript: Add animation to the github image using Javascript. Make it so that it moves around the page.
