# Personal-Website
With an aim to learn HTML, CSS, and possibly use Javascript, this is my personal website.


Here is the link to my university's provided personal website: http://homepage.usask.ca/~tup916/


Currently, I have only put up an HTML, and a CSS file for styling.
All images are created using Inkscape, GIMP, and the good-old Paint. Some images were hand-drawn as well.

Future plans:

Near future: 

Incorporte Javascript: Add animation to the github image using Javascript. Make it so that it floats around the page.
Update Camera:Photography to link to my Instagram photography.

Later-On:
Add more information, such as
		Picture-Link to:      
            Resume, and            
            Transcript            
		Art-Work:
            paintings,            
            doodles, and             
            sketches            
		Accomplishments:       
            Awards,            
            Scholarships,             
            Published papers and             
            Research Posters            
		Link to Travel Videos

	  
Also, keep experimenting with CSS and Javascript to learn more.
