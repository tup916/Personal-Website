Hi! My name is Tushita Patel.
I am a third-year Computer Science undergraduate student, with a concentration in Software Engineering and minors in Math and Statistics. 
I am interested in the areas of Data Science, Design and Human Computer Interaction.
When I am not in school, I love to travel, do art and help out in the community.
